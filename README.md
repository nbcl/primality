**Primality** helps you easily find, test and work with prime numbers in Python.

```python
primality.isprime(516349073509121311)
>> True

primality.nthprime(9999)
>> 104729

primality.prange(10)
>> [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]

primality.between(10,19)
>> [11, 13, 17, 19]

primality.nextprime(3)
>> 5

primality.prevprime(1000)
>> 997

```

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pypi.org/) to install Primality.

```bash
pip install primality
```

## Implementation

Primality officially supports Python 3.8+.

```python
from primality import primality
```

## Documentation

For usage documentation and examples, please check out our [wiki](/wiki) and [docs](docs).

## Theory

The current version uses the Miller primality test (1) with known strong pseudoprime bases (2) to provide deterministic testing for integers between 2 and 2^64 - 1. whether a given number is likely to be prime.
